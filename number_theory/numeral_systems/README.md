A numeral system (or system of numeration) is a writing system for expressing numbers; it is a mathematical notation for consistently representing numbers in a set using digit or other symbols.  

In various numeral systems, the same sequence of symbols might indicate different numbers. The number eleven in the decimal numeral system, the number three in the binary numeral system, and the number two in the unary numeral system are all represented by "11".
