(0) Pre-road: Syntax & Proof Style
    • formulas, inference rules, derivations
    • natural deduction / sequent calculus / Hilbert (pick one, keep moving)

      │
      ▼
(1) Propositional Logic (PL)
    • connectives: ¬ ∧ ∨ → ↔
    • truth tables, normal forms

      ├── exit A: SAT / proof complexity
      │        (CNF, DPLL, resolution)
      │
      ▼
(2) First-Order Logic (FOL)
    • quantifiers over individuals: ∀x ∃x
    • structures/models, satisfaction ⊨

      ├── exit B: Model Theory (the “structures” highway)
      │        (compactness, Löwenheim–Skolem, types, categoricity questions)
      │
      ├── exit C: Proof Theory (the “proofs about proofs” highway)
      │        (cut-elimination, normalization, consistency strength)
      │
      ├── exit D: Computability/Recursion (the “limits” highway)
      │        (Gödel, Turing, incompleteness, decidability)
      │
      ▼
(3) FOL + Equality + Theories
    • add "=" properly; study specific axiom systems:
      groups, rings, fields, Peano arithmetic, etc.

      ├── exit E: SMT / automated reasoning
      │        (theories + decision procedures: bitvectors, arrays, arithmetic)
      │
      ▼
(4) Second-Order Logic (SOL)
    • quantify over predicates/sets: ∀P, ∃P
    • huge expressive jump; “categorical” axiomatizations become possible

      ├── exit F: Descriptive set theory / foundations flavor
      │        (strength, definability, set existence principles)
      │
      ▼
(5) Higher-Order Logic (HOL)
    • quantify over functions/predicates of predicates…
    • often paired with types to stay sane

      ▼
(6) Simple Type Theory (STT / Typed HOL / Church)
    • types: α, β, α→β
    • functions are first-class; “higher order” becomes disciplined

      ├── exit G: λ-calculus (the PL/CS bridge)
      │        (simply typed λ, normalization, Curry–Howard)
      │
      ▼
(7) Dependent Type Theory (DTT / Martin-Löf)
    • types can depend on terms: Π-types, Σ-types
    • propositions-as-types becomes the main language

      ├── exit H: Constructive mathematics
      │        (proofs as programs; extract algorithms from proofs)
      │
      ▼
(8) “Proof Assistant Core” (practical foundations)
    • universes + inductive types + recursion principles
    • this is where Coq/Lean/Agda/Idris live (flavors differ)

      ▼
(9) Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) / Univalence / HITs
    • equality becomes path-like; types behave like spaces
    • “higher-dimensional” foundations

      ▼
(10) Cubical Type Theory / ∞-directions
    • computational control of univalence
    • meets higher category theory / ∞-toposes on the horizon


LEGEND (why this feels like a road):
• Each step adds a new “kind of thing you can quantify over / treat as a citizen.”
  PL: truth of statements
  FOL: individuals
  SOL: predicates/sets of individuals
  HOL/STT: functions (organized by types)
  DTT: propositions/types indexed by terms (dependent structure)
  HoTT: equality upgraded to geometry (paths/higher paths)
