Modal Logic is an extension of classical propositional and predicate logic that deals with the concepts of necessity, possibility, and contingency.  

It falls under formal logic and is closely tied to philosopy (logic, metaphysics), computer science, artificial intellgence, and linguistics.  

It uses ▢  for "necessarily true" and ◇  for "possibly true".  

It is often characterized by **possible worlds semantics**, where a statement is necessary if true in all possible worlds, and possible if true in at least one world.   

"The idea of possible worlds to describe an ontology goes back to the famous German mathematician and philosopher Leibniz. Leibniz, while discussing the problem of evil, remarked that the god created the world as the best out of all possible worlds. In his picture, therefore, there are variety of possible worlds $w0, w1, w2, . . . ,$ but the god (according to some calculation) picked the best one, say $w0,$ and created the world according to it. In other words, we do consider the other worlds possible.  Furthermore, there is a relation between our world w0 and the other worlds $w1, w2$ etc. Following Leibniz’s analogy, $w0$ is the actual state we are in now as it is the best possible one."
