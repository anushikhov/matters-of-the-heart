Mathematical logic is the study of formal logic within mathematics, focused on formal systems, proof theory, and the foundations of mathematics.  

Its four main branches are:   
* Model Theory   
* Proof Theory   
* Set Theory  
* Recursion Theory  

These fields explore the mathematical properties of formal systems, validity, and computational limits, along with Metalogic, Proposition & Predicate Logic, Type Theory collectively provide the tools for understanding mathematical reasoning, computational complexity, and the limitations of formal systems.
